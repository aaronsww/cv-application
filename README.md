<a href="https://cv-application-three.vercel.app/">Live Demonstartion.</a>

## Project Summary

A web application built with React and Zustand that allows users to create their own CV with dynamic options and a pre-defined styled format. The application provides a user-friendly interface to create a customized CV quickly and easily

The state management is handled by <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand">Zustand</a>, a minimalistic state management library that provides a simple and efficient way to manage the application state. The use of Zustand makes the application more performant and easier to reason about, as it allows for a centralized and predictable state management.
